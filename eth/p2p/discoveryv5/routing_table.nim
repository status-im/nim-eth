  ## The routing table IP limits are applied on both the total table, and on the

  ## entries waiting in the replacement cache are accounted for. This way, the
  ## replacement cache can't get filled with nodes that then can't be added due
  ## to the limits that apply.
  ##
  ## As entries are not verified (=contacted) immediately before or on entry, it
  ## is possible that a malicious node could fill (poison) the routing table or
  ## a specific bucket with ENRs with IPs it does not control. The effect of
  ## this would be that a node that actually owns the IP could have a difficult
  ## time getting its ENR distrubuted in the DHT and as a consequence would
  ## not be reached from the outside as much (or at all). However, that node can
  ## still search and find nodes to connect to. So it would practically be a
  ## similar situation as a node that is not reachable behind the NAT because
  ## port mapping is not set up properly.
  ## There is the possiblity to set the IP limit on verified (=contacted) nodes
  ## only, but that would allow for lookups to be done on a higher set of nodes
  ## owned by the same identity. This is a worse alternative.
  ## Next, doing lookups only on verified nodes would slow down discovery start
  ## up.
